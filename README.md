# Model X knockoff variable selection

A suite of tools for implementing model X knockoffs with a variety of models, including gradient boosted machines, ridge regression, LASSO, and neural networks.

Based on the [original work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5609) by Barber and Candes et al (2015)

The model X knockoff framework is used as a variable selection tool while controlling for the FDR. As it can be implemented for a wide range of models, it is very powerful in situations where typical statistical models lack the ability to capture heterogeneity.

See [DESCRIPTION.pdf]() for implementation details.
